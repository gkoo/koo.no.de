  | In my freshman year of college, my dorm resident assistant
  | put a guitar in my hands and taught me a handful of chords
  | and the basics of strumming. Since then, I've become quite
  | fond of playing guitar (and more recently, ukulele) and
  | it's my most frequent and enjoyed hobby today.

  | I like to work on websites. I suppose that's a good trait
  | to have for someone in my profession. My proclivity to
  | work on personal projects outside of work started with
  | my discovery of
  a(href='http://blog.linkedin.com/topic/linkedin-indays/linkedin-hackdays/')
    = 'LinkedIn\'s Hackdays'
  | , an internal event
  | hosted every month where employees are encouraged to work
  | on side projects and learn about new technologies.
